 Desktop-Based System Project (VB.NET + MS Access)

This is a Windows desktop application developed using VB.NET with a Microsoft Access database. The project was created as part of a school assignment to demonstrate fundamental concepts in building a basic CRUD system with a graphical user interface and database connectivity.

 Project Overview

Built using Windows Forms in VB.NET

Implements full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

- Uses MS Access (.accdb) as the backend database

- Features a user-friendly interface with form validations

- Organized codebase and modular design for readability and maintainability

 Project Structure

frmLogin.vb – Main dashboard or starting point of the system

MDIParent1.vb – Form to see the records through ListView.

StudentAdd.vb – Form for adding record.

Students.accdb – MS Access database file storing all the records. You can find this database on my folder "FINALPROJECT/FINALPROJECT/bin/Debug"

Resources/ – Icons, logos, or other media files used in the app

Note: The database connection is done through OdbcConnection.

 Features

- Secure and simple login system

- Add, edit, delete, and search records

- Validation to prevent empty or incorrect inputs

- Easy database backup and restoration

- Clean and responsive UI for easy navigation

 How to Run the Project

- Clone or download the repository

- Open the project using Visual Studio

- Make sure the Database.accdb file path is correctly set in the connection string

- Build and run the project 

- You can see the password in "frmLogin.vb"

Tip: Ensure that you have Microsoft Access Database Engine installed for database connectivity.
